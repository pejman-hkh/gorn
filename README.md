# GORN
Gorn is Golang + ReactJs + Nextjs

This project is under development yet.

At first, my purpose is to write a tiny blog with the User, Group (with permission), Menu, Post, Setting, Comment, and Page features.

I used `Flowbite` and `Vite` with `Reactjs` as the admin panel

For backend I used gin + gorm for api

For frontend I will used nextjs

At the end, I want to develop an ecommerce for it
